In this repository, we demonstrated four challenges in data science: feature extraction reduces datasets into efficient variables that preserve essential information; modeling non‑stationarity and equilibrium detects shifts in trends or volatility, with equilibrium as a stable balance; handling multicollinearity resolves issues with highly correlated predictors using PCA or ridge regression; and detecting regime change identifies structural shifts, such as market crises, through change‑point analysis or hidden Markov models, followed by separate modeling.
